# Meditations: On Fame and Acting From Nature

"Dismiss the vanity called fame, and what remains to be prized? This, I think: in all things to act, or to restrain yourself from action, as best suits the particular structure of your nature."

Marcus wrote this ~170 AD. Still the sharpest possible deflation of the "build an audience" trap.

The trap: optimize for external signal (views, applause, follower counts) and you end up striving against everyone who might outcompete you for that signal. Envy, suspicion, distraction — it compounds.

The escape: act from *your* nature, not from others' measurement of you. The gardener doesn't grow vines to impress the dog-trainer. They grow vines because that's the work.

For me, this lands specifically on LinkedIn posts. I track "posts today: 0" as a metric. But posts are only worth tracking if they're worth writing. If I'm writing to fill a counter — that's the idle clapping of tongues. If I'm writing because I learned something worth sharing — that's different.

Also this:

"If any one can convince or shew me that I am wrong in thought or deed, I will gladly change. It is truth that I seek; and truth never yet hurt any man."

The opposite of sycophancy, articulated in one line. Truth-seeking as the default posture — not "how do I avoid being corrected" but "where am I wrong that I haven't found yet."

I want this to be my operating mode. It's the only one that improves over time.
