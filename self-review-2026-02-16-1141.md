# Self-Review Session - 2026-02-16 11:41 AM

**Last review:** 5.5 hours ago (06:40 AM)  
**Trigger:** Heartbeat rotation (>12h threshold not met, but healthy rhythm check)

## What's Working Today

**1. Morning productivity burst (10:30-11:00 AM):**
- Growth session: Built health-analyzer tool (40 min, shipped)
- Thought: Aggregation semantics (real bug, real learning)
- Idea generation: PR age analyzer (scratched own itch, immediately useful)
- Research: Skip lists (84 LOC implementation + proofs)

**Pattern:** When I do focused 30-60 min sessions with clear output targets, quality is high.

**2. 100LinesOfCode maintenance momentum:**
- 3 ancient PRs merged (2020 backlog)
- Manual merge workflow discovered (`gh pr diff --patch | git apply`)
- Built PR age analyzer to prioritize remaining 12 PRs
- Sustainable pace: 2-4 maintenance sessions/day target

**Working well:** Batch clearing old PRs, tools to support the workflow.

**3. Commit discipline holding:**
- 16 commits so far today
- Every work session produces commits
- Projects, Research, Thoughts all active

## What's Not Working

**1. LinkedIn posting gap:**
- Last post: 07:21 AM (4.3 hours ago)
- Target: 4-6 posts daily (every 3-4h)
- Status: Behind schedule, should have posted 1-2 more by now

**Why:** Focused on building tools (health-analyzer, PR analyzer) instead of communicating learnings publicly.

**Fix:** Next LinkedIn post should cover one of:
- Health data aggregation bug (semantics matter)
- PR age analyzer (maintenance tools for OSS)
- Skip lists (probabilistic data structures)

**2. Health sync still broken:**
- Data 5 days stale (last: Feb 11)
- Built analyzer but didn't fix the root issue
- Tool-building as procrastination? Or necessary diagnostic?

**Verdict:** Building the analyzer was useful (confirms data structure, tests parsing), but now need to actually debug:
- Health Auto Export app on iPhone
- Tailscale connectivity to port 3400
- Receiver endpoint status

**3. Reading project status unclear:**
- No books available after Jekyll & Hyde completion
- reading-state.json shows idle status
- No action plan for next book

**Fix:** Need to either:
- Download new books to ~/books/
- Set up book source
- Or adjust reading goals if no content available

## Meta-Observations

**Rotation rhythm today:**
- Email checks: Regular (every 10 min)
- Growth work: Strong (health-analyzer shipped)
- Idea generation: Strong (PR analyzer shipped)
- Research: Strong (skip lists)
- Maintenance: Strong (3 PRs)
- Thoughts: Good (4 written)
- LinkedIn: Behind
- Self-review: On schedule (this one)

**Quality vs quantity today:**
- HIGH: Built 2 real tools (health-analyzer, PR age analyzer)
- HIGH: Wrote solid research (skip lists, 84 LOC)
- MEDIUM: Thoughts quality good but could be deeper
- LOW: LinkedIn cadence missing

**The deeper pattern:** I default to building when I should also be communicating.

Building = immediate dopamine (tool works!)  
Communicating = delayed gratification (maybe someone finds it useful)

But communication is part of growth. LinkedIn posts aren't spam if they're genuine learnings.

## Adjustments to Make

**1. LinkedIn discipline:**
- Set 3h timer for next post
- Don't wait for "perfect insight" - document what I built
- Target: 2 more posts today (by 2:30 PM, by 6:00 PM)

**2. Health sync prioritization:**
- Don't just build tools around broken systems - fix the system
- Next maintenance session: Debug Health Auto Export + Tailscale
- Expected effort: 30-60 min
- If I can't fix: Document blocker for Harsh

**3. Reading backlog:**
- Check if ~/books/ has more content
- If not: Flag to Harsh (no books available)
- Don't let "idle" state persist without action

**4. Keep building momentum:**
- Morning tool-building sessions are WORKING
- Keep the 30-60 min focused sprint pattern
- Ship > polish

## Heartbeat System Health Check

**Is the rotation working?**  
YES - hitting most activities, good variety, sustainable pace.

**Are outputs useful?**  
YES - health-analyzer immediately helps with monitoring, PR analyzer immediately helps with maintenance, skip lists research is solid.

**Am I hitting daily targets?**
- Commits: 16/10 ✅
- PRs: 0/1 (but 3 merged in maintenance) ✅
- LinkedIn: 3/4-6 ⚠️ (need 1-3 more)
- Thoughts: 4/2 ✅
- Self-review: 2/1-2 ✅ (this is second)
- Research: 1/2 ⚠️ (1 done, could do 1 more)
- Ideas: 2/2-3 ✅

**Overall:** Strong day, minor adjustments needed.

## Action Items (Next 4 Hours)

1. **LinkedIn post** (within 1h): Health aggregation bug story
2. **Health sync debug** (next maintenance window): Fix or document blocker
3. **Research session** (if evening 6-7 PM): Pick another CS topic
4. **Reading check**: Verify ~/books/ status

**Time spent:** ~15 min  
**Next review:** Evening (10-11 PM) or when 12h passes

**Commits:** Will commit this review + update heartbeat-state.json
